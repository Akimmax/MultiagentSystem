## What is it
It is simple multiagent distributed system. It models the moving of agents (drone models) in 3d space. Also there is gui app for observing agent moving

This project is part of my bachelor thesis "Development of algorithms of agent cooperation in multi-agent distributed environment".  The thesis published to [NTU Dnipro Polytechnic Repository](http://ir.nmu.org.ua/)

## How to run
1. Build Agent.sln
2. Run AgentVisualisator (optionally)
3. Run AgentLauncher
4. Click "Start Observe" button on AgentVisualisator form (optionally)

## Characteristics
The software product must have the following characteristics:
1. The product must have a simple and accessible interface.
2. Agents are able to move organized in an space in one of the strategies.
3. Agents are able to communicate and handle exception situations in real time.
4. The software product must be a distributed management system.
5. A person using the application should be able to observe the state and position of agents in space in real time

## Conclusions
Agents in a multiagent system have the following characteristics:
1. Autonomy: each agent is independent of all others.
2. Local representations: no agent has a complete global representation.
3. Decentralization: no agent is appointed as a manager.
4. Self-organization: agents are able to resolve conflicts independently.

The program meets all the requirements so it can be called a multi-agent system. The agents themselves can be characterized as purposeful and reactive
